Hello there! I'm sure it's just another day, you are looking at your zodiac sign and feeling a sense of belonging. Well, now its time to mint a zodiac NFT for yourself.

## Steps to setup the application on your local machine.

_(make sure that you have node and npm installed)_

- Clone the repo into your local machine
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hiteshkhode/horoscopeNFTs.git
```
- You get two directories _client_ and _smartContracts_.
- Change the directory you want to work on.
```sh
cd client
```
or
```sh
cd smartContracts
```

- In client, make sure to install the node dependencies.

```

- In smartContracts, you can edit smart contracts, preferred IDE being Ethereum's _Remix_. Deploy your customized contracts and have fun.
